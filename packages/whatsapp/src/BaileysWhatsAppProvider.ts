/**
 * Real WhatsApp integration built on Baileys (@whiskeysockets/baileys), an
 * open-source implementation of the WhatsApp Web multi-device protocol.
 *
 * Chosen over the official WhatsApp Cloud/Business API because this project
 * needs the *WhatsApp Web-style QR-code pairing* explicitly requested by the
 * product spec, with no per-conversation billing and no Meta Business
 * verification step. Trade-off (documented, not hidden): Baileys is an
 * unofficial client — WhatsApp's Terms of Service technically prohibit
 * unofficial clients, and protocol changes on WhatsApp's side can break the
 * library until it is updated upstream. For a production deployment with a
 * commercial SLA requirement, swap this class for a Cloud API-backed
 * implementation of the same WhatsAppProvider interface — no other module
 * in the codebase needs to change.
 *
 * NOTE: this class talks to WhatsApp's real servers. It cannot be exercised
 * end-to-end inside an offline/sandboxed CI run; use MockWhatsAppProvider
 * for automated tests and local demos, and this class for a real staging
 * device.
